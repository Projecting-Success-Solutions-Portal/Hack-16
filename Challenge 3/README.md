**Emergent Heart, Identifying the signals of intuition**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: People

**Summary**

One of the challenges presented at Project:Hack15 was a theoretical challenge around identifying emergent signals. Teams where tasked with preparing theories and concepts around how we identify historically unidentifiable signals and how we use these to determine and act on unforeseeable risk. One of the theories raised by the teams was of tracking the mood and feeling of all staff and contributors on a project to try and identify if the general feeling of teams can be used to alert of times of concern. We want to explore this further. For this challenge, teams will be facing the problem of how we record, automate and track general mood, raising concerns and feelings across a project.

**Pain Points**

- We want to be able to capture the intuitive mood of a project based on countless years of experience within the team
- We want to know what can be identified with this data and how to ensure we are not over fitting or finding random correlation
- We want to ensure that it is safe and easy for staff to contribute to this without fearing repercussions and without stepping into emotional wellbeing territory.
- We want to leverage knowledge and experience that cannot be captured in a traditional or obvious way
- We don’t want to have to rely on higher managers and senior staff members to identify when a project needs intervention

**User Stories**

- As a senior decision maker, I want to understand if our projects are in a riskier environment, so that I can ensure that steps are taken and support is provided to ensure the continuity of our projects
- As a Project Lead, I want to understand my staffs unspoken feelings, so that I can ensure that appropriate procedures are put in place to mitigate unidentified risk
- As a Portfolio Manager, I want to ensure that my Project Lead is not the only identifier I have for a projects health, So that I can understand and be aware of potential issues within my projects
- As a Project Professional, I want to pass my feeling and sentiment about the current state of a project to senior leadership even when I cannot necessarily define them, so that support can be provided to ensure that my project goes ahead smoothly and within expectations


**Context**

During Project:Hack15 some teams tackled the challenge of identifying emergent signals within projects. One key aspect that was identified and has been a rising discussion within the project profession is the ability to track and record sentiment within a project. The theory being that most projects will have near countless years of experience between all the people involved and so often they will have unique and highly valuable insight that as of yet is not recorded. Most project professionals will have an innate instinct around how a project is going and we want to capture this. In addition to this there has been a number of concerns within projects of project leads and senior project staff potentially gatekeeping information about a projects health, this can often lead to senior leaders being unable to support a project that is going off track because they simple do not know that anything is wrong.

Can we tackle these problems by creating a system that collects rudimentary mood and sentiment data from staff involved in projects. Can we use this data to identify if a project has entered a risky period and if we need to raise mitigations to reduce risk. Additionally, can we use this data to raise concerns with senior leadership without needing to pass the information through project leads.

There are a number of avenues to take this challenge and we want to leave it as open ended as possible, we do not want you to try and identify peoples mental health or emotional state as that would potentially devalue the data being contributed. The goal is to understand the project, not the individual.

You will need to create a method to collect and store this data, write rules on how it is collect. Identify how we can use and understand it and how we can visualise it to promote intervention. Think about the people who will need to contribute their thoughts and the leaders that will need to analyse the data.

Finally, we recommend away from spending too long discussing the contents of a questionnaire. You simple need to prepare a few questions/data points for figuring our an employee’s general vibe and how they are feeling about a project. We would also recommend that you make it straightforward to modify any questions you write as they will inevitable need to be changed with time.

**Dataset Description**

There is no data provided for this challenge, we would recommend generating some synthetic data to support your visuals. To begin with you should create a randomly generated data set. If you have additional time or what to dedicate more time to how you show off your tool we recommend creating a dataset that shows a few spikes in concern at various points, potentially consider making different staff have a tendency towards different average scores.

**Output**

A data collection tool, either a form or a power app. A data structure and database for managing the data and leveraging the best advantage you can from the data. Visuals and analysis aimed at the right users, specifically senior leaders, portfolio/program managers and project leads.

**Benefit**

The benefit of this challenge could be found to be a significant source of insight into the health of projects and the mitigation of black swan events within projects. Not only is this concept filled with potential uses and adaptions to alternate industries, there is also growing evidence of its importance and case studies that have begun to show that this is possible.
