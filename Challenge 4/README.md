**Healthy Minds, Healthy Lives**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: People

**Summary**

Within the workplace, we would like to analyse the differing attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders. Understanding this would provide an insight in how each employee would like to work to optimise their productivity whilst ensuring a positive workplace. Identify what factors need to be highlighted based on survey data and use data mining to create various proposals for implementing workplace improvements.

**Pain Points**

- How do we reduce the stigma surrounding mental health in the workplace
- How do we identify what business can do to create a mentally resilient environment
- Can we identify what factors play the biggest part in employee mental health
- Can we create clear and concise action proposals based on data

**User Stories**

- As a HR Manager, I would like to be able to understand the wellbeing within our company and how company factors may impact mental health. This is to ensure that individuals are provided the correct pastoral care and that they understand what resources are available to them.

- As a Business Owner, I would like to determine how well my staff are looked after and how we can reduce issues in the business. This is to increase mental wellbeing and a more productive environment. 

**Context**

Mental health affects your emotional, psychological and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. In the workplace, communication and inclusion are keys skills for successful high performing teams or employees. 

The impact of mental health to an organization can mean an increase of absent days from work and a decrease in productivity and engagement. In the UK, approximately 1 in 7 people (14%) experience mental health problems in the workplace. Where evidence also suggests that 12.7% of all sickness absence days in the UK can be attributed to mental health conditions.

We propose that you use data mining software such as Orange3 to analyse the data, if you wish to create your own machine learning model as well then this challenge should offer a great opportunity for that as well. As extension work you should bring in more data, there is a significant amount of publicly available data within this field, consider how you can use it to support any hypothesis.

**Dataset Description**

All the data is sourced from a non-profit corporation, Open Sourcing Mental Illness, which is dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. OSMI began in 2013, with Ed Finkler speaking at tech conferences about his personal experiences as a web developer and open source advocate with a mental health disorder. The response was overwhelming, and thus OSMI was born.

This dataset is from various surveys that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. To view all of the surveys here is a link: https://osmhhelp.org/research

The surveys are filled by respondents who suffer from mental health disorders (diagnose or un-diagnosed by medical, even it's just a feeling) in tech companies and see if any factors can affect the employee to get treatment or not.

**Output**

This challenge is based heavily on creating clear data analysis and presenting it alongside actionable insight to a senior leader. 

Use data mining to predict whether the individual should be treated of their mental illness or not according to the values obtained in the dataset. Investigate the relationship between mental health disorder and age, gender, etc
A potentially strong starting point would be to show the impact of working from home against working in an office against other mental health factors.

**Benefit**

Organisations that incorporate mental health awareness help to create a healthy and productive work environment that reduces the stigma associated with mental illness, increases the organizations mental health literacy and teaches the skills to safely and responsibly respond to a co-workers mental health concern.

Incorporating mental health awareness in the workplace can help lead the way for mental health issues throughout your community by equipping people with the tools they need to start a dialogue so that more people can get the help they need.
From the output, it starts the process for employees to be heard about their mental health where there can be an understanding of why individuals canâ€™t work to what is expected. 

**Useful Resources**

Within the folder is a word document with a glossary of the key terms for the columns in the mental health raw data excel file.
