They did not care if I had mental health issues and needed time off- they would consistently tell me to work from home or communicate with them what was going on with me. I did not want to disclose this information with anyone, since the HR Manager at my branch would not keep information confidential, and it was eventually known to other employees in the company that I was out due to mental illness, even though I did not tell anyone except HR (which is NECESSARY when going on leave!)

If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work? We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee. So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences) 1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life. 2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly. 3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving. 4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.","",0,42,MALE,United States of America,Florida,White,"",United States of America,Florida,,,"","C:\Users\User\Continuum Consulting\Client Documents - Documents (1)\Team\Hackathon\2022\20220807 - ProjectHack 16\General\Challenges\Challenge 4 - Healthy Mind, Healthy Lives\Solution Challenge 4\Inputs\Mental Health Data.xlsx|||2019",1,Some did,I was aware of some,"No, at none of my previous employers",0,"",Maybe/Not sure,Maybe/Not sure,0,2019

At some point, my performance became a topic and I ended up crying.

It is where all the unnecessary pressure starts, the unnecessary short deadlines, the frequent change of priority.
